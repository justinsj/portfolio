## Make it your own!

This was written to be configurable since the start, so you can simply override all the interfaces present in `config` folder which contains all the config for `projects`, `articles`, `videos`.

Custom providers can also be easily implemented. For example if you'd like to render articles from `medium.com` rather than `dev.to`.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Developer

```
npm run dev
```

## Production

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
